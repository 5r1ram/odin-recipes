    <h2>Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese.</li>
            <li>Baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</li>
            <li>Italy has many variations of pizza. The Neapolitan pizza, or Naples-style pizza, is made specifically with buffalo mozzarella</li>
            <li>The Ligurian pizza resembles the pissaladière of Provence in France, adding anchovies to olives and onions</li>
            <li>Pizza has also spread from Italy throughout much of the rest of the world, and, in regions outside of Italy, the toppings used vary with the ingredients available and the flavour profile preferred.</li>
