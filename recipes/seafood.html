    <h2>Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>seafood, edible aquatic animals, excluding mammals, but including both freshwater and ocean creatures.</li>
            <li>Most nontoxic aquatic species are exploited for food by humans.</li>
            <li>Even those with toxic properties, such as certain blowfish, can be prepared so as to circumvent harm to the consumer.</li>
            <li>Fish and other seafood may be humanity’s most important food, after cereals, furnishing about 15 percent of the world population’s protein intake.</li>
            <li>Lean fish muscle provides 18–25 percent protein by weight, the equivalent of beef or poultry, but is much lower in calories.</li>
            <li> In fish one gram of protein is present for 4 to 10 calories, as contrasted with 10–20 calories per protein gram for lean meats and up to 30 for fatty meats.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Live lobsters, 1 per person.</li>
