    <h2>Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Soft boiled eggs are my new obsession.</li>
            <li>whites of the eggs are firm, but the yolk stays silky, creamy, and in a liquid gold state.</li>
            <li>It is a little like a cross between butter and melted cheese.</li>
            <li>They are seriously divine. And they are not just for breakfast!</li>
            <li>I enjoy soft boiled eggs with toast, as an addition to bowl meals, as a topper for salads or soup (hello, ramen!), or just as a quick snack.</li>
        </ul>
